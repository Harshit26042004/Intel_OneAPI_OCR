&nbsp &nbsp Digitization the Handwritten or Photo characters was a manual
process in before days. This was a time consuming thing and it is manually
expensive. Such handwritten or image characters are difficult to read by 
visual-impaired people. This Traditional method can be overcome with the 
help of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) System.In this 
project,we propose a deep learning- based OCR system which will be more
accurate and efficient with the help of Intel OneAPI platform.
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp The proposed system uses a convolutional neural
network(CNN)model to detect the characters from the image. The model
is trained on a large Dataset of labelled images using the OneAPI 
Platform.
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp The Image is collected and organised for the classification of
characters and letters.The characters are detected with CNN models and 
trained with OneAPI platform in accurate and efficient manner , Where text
characters are extracted separately.
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp Further , The trained model can predict the sample data images in
accurate and time-efficient way based on Intel machines , including CPU
and GPU's.With Add-On feature , we will also try to implement audio as an 
output , which is very useful for visual- impaired people.
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp In conclusion, This OCR system using Intel OneAPI has
potential to digitalize the handwritten and predict it in a higher
accuracy and time-efficiency.
